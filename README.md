# ü¶ß
i'm conor, a web dev based in Brooklyn, NY.

full-time, I support the web ecosystem of GW Medicine, an academic medical system. I code new UIs, custom applications, and automation tools in service of medical patients, faculty, students, and administrators.

my github mostly contains personal projects, as I can't show much code from work - my [portfolio site](https://conorkelley.me) is the best look at what I do!

usually I'm building with:
* TypeScript / JavaScript
* Modern CSS / SCSS
* Vue.js
* SvelteKit
* Drupal
* PHP
